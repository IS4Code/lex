# v1.x.y
- Added [[fallthrough]], [[nodiscard]] and [[unlikely]] attributes to

  This argument was undocumented and only intended for use in the library.

# v1.0.1

- Reduced the size of a match result object by optimizing it for patterns
  with up to 2 captures. Patterns with more than 2 captures will allocate
  memory on the heap.
